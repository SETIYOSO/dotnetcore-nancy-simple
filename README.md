# .NET Core and Nancy example code

This is a simple DotnetCore-NancyFX to get basic working "hello world" based on [jpf code](https://github.com/jpf/dotnet-core-and-nancy-example)


- .Net Core 2.1.4
- NancyFX 2.0.0 ClienEastwood


# Step 1: Install .NET Core

First step is to [install .NET core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), this is pretty easy to do, just follow the instructions. You'll know that the install worked if you can type this in your terminal and see a result:

```sh
dotnet --version
```


# Step 2: Clone this repo and run 


```sh
dotnet run
```

Since dotnet 2.x, above command will also invoke **dotnet restore** and **dotnet build**, which is convenient.
